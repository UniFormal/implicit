A common problem when defining modular theory hierarchies is that the most natural include-hierarchy for the most important theories is not necessarily the same as the most comprehensive hierarchy.
For example, Ex.~\ref{syn:incl} defines \cn{Group} with an include from \cn{Monoid}.
Instead, we could have used an intermediate theory and includes $\cn{Monoid}\harr \cn{CancellationMonoid}\harr\cn{Group}$.

It is very common to have increasingly strong theories $R,S,T$, where a design with two includes $R\harr S\harr T$ is not desirable:
\begin{compactitem}
 \item Often $R\harr T$ has been defined first and $S$ only later.
   This is very common because people usually formalize the most important theories (e.g., \cn{Monoid} and \cn{Group}) first.
   But inserting $S$ is not easy in retrospect --- changing the theory hierarchy (which is one of the most fundamental structures of a library) usually presents a very expensive refactoring problem.
   And even if we systematically use includes for every known intermediate theory like $S$ (as done in \cite{mathscheme}), we might later discover a new intermediate theory that should have been added.
 \item Often the most natural axioms to use in $T$ are the same independent of whether $T$ includes $R$ or $S$ (e.g., users might prefer the usual inverse-element axioms in \cn{Group} even if they have included \cn{CancellationMonoid}).
 In that case, the axioms of $S$ become provable in $T$ if we use $R\harr S\harr T$.
 This either causes $T$ to have redundant axioms or requires a more complex include mechanism that allows $T$ to include $S$ in a way that turns some of $S$-axioms into theorems.
\end{compactitem}

Therefore, it is common to use a commuting triangle consisting of two includes $R\harr T$ and $R\harr S$ and one morphism $m:S\to T$.
But this is awkward because the relation ``every $T$ is an $S$'' is now mediated by $m$ rather than being canonical.  
Implicit morphisms provide a simple solution to this problem: we keep the triangle but make the morphism $m$ implicit.
This captures exactly the canonical conversion from $S$ to $T$.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Already the elementary algebraic hierarchy provides countless examples of such situations.
For a small fragment of the hierarchy of magmas, Figure~\ref{fig:magmas} shows one possible design using numerous implicit morphisms.
In particular, it uses some of the examples and features from this paper, e.g., an implicit isomorphism to identify the order-theoretic and the algebraic development of semilattices.

It also uses multiple implicit morphisms to introduce the various intermediate theories between $\cn{Band}\harr\cn{SemiLattice}$. 
All of these are of the form $t=\{\icl{\cn{Band}},\,a: F\}$, e.g., \cn{LeftRegularBand} uses $F=\forall x,z. z\circ x\circ z \doteq z\circ x$.
The implicit morphisms map the constants from \cn{Band} to themselves and the axiom $a$ to a proof.
It is straightforward to prove that this part of the diagram commutes: any two morphisms are identical except for the assignment to the axiom $a$, and these are equal due to proof irrelevance.%
