A good example for the usefulness of implicit morphisms is the lattice of \emph{bands}. A band is an idempotent semigroup. There are several varieties of bands which can all be defined by a single governing equation, resulting in the lattice in \autoref{fig:bands}.

\caption{The Lattice of Varieties of Bands}\label{fig:bands}
\end{figure}

As the diagram suggests, even though each node in the lattice is definable via a single equation, each of them implies the connected equations above it. Hence formalizing the varieties of bands via includes would add the implied equations as \emph{additional axioms}, even though they are provable.

Using implict morphisms between the varieties however can turn the axiom in a variety of bands into a theorem in another variety. \autoref{fig:bandsmmt} shows a subset of this lattice implemented with implict morphisms.
